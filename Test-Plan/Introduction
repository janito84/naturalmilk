The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach.  This document will clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.

Test plans determine the overall approach for testing an application and outline the strategy, scope, team, risks, approaches to testing, and other pertinent information.

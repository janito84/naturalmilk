Quality Control approach is focused on the process whereas the problems that customers may face can also occur elsewhere in the production 
and distribution chain.
A quality assurance approach therefore, includes the whole production and distribution system, from the suppliers of important goods, 
foods, through the internal business management to the customer. 
Quality assurance systems should be documented in a simple way to show who has responsibility for doing what and when. 
The focus of quality assurance is prevention and this should mean that action is taken to meet a specification and prevent failures 
from occurring a second time. This is done by planning, management action, agreements with key suppliers and other people in the distribution chain.
The test approach will include positive and negative (break-it) functional tests. In addition, to ensure reliability throughout the iterative software 
development cycle, regression tests will be performed on all iterations of the application.
This Test Approach and the Test Plan, Test Cases were created using the Business Requirements.
To ensure reliability, the test approach will include positive and negative (break-it) functional tests. In addition, to ensure reliability throughout 
the iterative software development cycle, regression tests will be performed on all iterations of the application.
A part of the approach in testing will be to initially perform a ‘Smoke Test’ upon delivery of the application for testing. 
Testing will be performed from a black-box approach, not based on any knowledge of internal design or code. Tests will be designed around requirements 
and functionality.
